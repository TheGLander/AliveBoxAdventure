# Alive Box Adventure

This is the source code for the [Alive Box Adventure](https://g-lander.itch.io/alive-box-adventure).

It is made with Godot 3.4.4.

The art was made with TuxPaint, KolourPaint, and a tad bit of GIMP.

The font used is xos4. I have no idea where it came from or where to find it elsewhere, except that there's a release of it over at the [Powerline fonts GitHub repository](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) and that it's licensing seems to allow it to be used here.

The file structure and code is kinda a mess, but I suppose it's how it goes with game development(?).

The code is licensed under the MIT license, the art is licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0 International, and the font is licensed under the whatever license it has.
